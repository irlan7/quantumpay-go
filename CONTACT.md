# Contact

This repository is part of the **QuantumPay Protocol**.

To keep communication secure, efficient, and free from spam, we use **structured contact channels** instead of open personal emails.

## 📣 General Communication

- **GitHub Issues**  
  For technical questions, documentation clarifications, or non-sensitive discussions.  
  → Use the appropriate issue template when available.

## 🔐 Security Reports

For **security vulnerabilities** or sensitive disclosures:

- Follow the process described in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md)
- **Do not** open public issues for security matters.

## 🧭 Governance & Protocol Matters

For governance-related questions:

- Refer first to [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md)
- If escalation is required, follow the governance process described there.

## 🧑‍💼 Enterprise / Operational Contact

For enterprise use cases (managed nodes, compliance tooling, support):

- Contact will be announced **after mainnet stability milestone**
- Until then, no commercial support channels are active

## 🚫 What We Do Not Respond To

To protect contributors and maintainers, we do not respond to:

- Investment solicitations
- Token price discussions
- Unverified partnership offers
- Marketing / influencer outreach
- Cold emails or unsolicited DMs

## 🛡️ Anti-Impersonation Notice

There is **no official Telegram, WhatsApp, or social media DM support** at this stage.

Any account claiming to represent QuantumPay privately is **unauthorized**.

## 📅 Future Contact Disclosure

Additional contact channels (foundation, operations, compliance) will be published only after:

- Mainnet launch
- Governance framework activation
- Legal entities (if any) are formally established

Until then, **GitHub is the single source of truth**.
