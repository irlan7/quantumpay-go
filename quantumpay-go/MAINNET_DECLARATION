# Quantumpay Mainnet Declaration

This document formally declares the launch and operational principles of the Quantumpay Mainnet.

Quantumpay Mainnet is intended to operate as a long-lived, infrastructure-grade blockchain network,
prioritizing correctness, determinism, and trust over rapid change or experimentation.

## Mainnet Status

Quantumpay Mainnet is declared **live** once the following conditions are met:

- Genesis block is finalized and published
- Chain ID is fixed and immutable
- At least two independent nodes are running
- Core protocol behavior is frozen
- Governance and operational documents are published

Once declared live, the network is considered production infrastructure.

## Chain Identity

- **Network Name:** Quantumpay Mainnet  
- **Chain ID:** 77001  

### Chain ID Immutability

The Quantumpay Mainnet Chain ID is permanent.

Once mainnet is live, the Chain ID **MUST NOT** be changed, reused, overridden, or reassigned under any circumstances.

Any future protocol evolution must occur through explicit versioning and governance processes, not by modifying the Chain ID.

Changing the Chain ID after mainnet launch is considered a protocol violation.

## Genesis and Ledger Integrity

- The genesis block defines the initial state of the Quantumpay Mainnet
- Genesis parameters are final once published
- Ledger history is append-only
- There is no mechanism for retroactive state modification

Ledger integrity is enforced by protocol rules and consensus, not by any individual or organization.

## Upgrade and Change Policy

- There are no automatic upgrades
- Node operators decide when to upgrade
- Protocol-breaking changes require formal governance approval
- Backward compatibility is preserved whenever possible

Emergency changes are limited to security mitigation and follow documented governance procedures.

## Governance Authority

Quantumpay Mainnet governance follows a maintainer-driven model as described in `GOVERNANCE.md`.

- There are no administrator backdoors
- There is no emergency kill switch
- No entity has unilateral control over the ledger

All authority is constrained by protocol rules and public governance processes.

## Operator Responsibility

Node operators are responsible for:

- Running supported node versions
- Monitoring node health
- Applying upgrades intentionally
- Maintaining their own infrastructure security

Quantumpay does not provide custodial services or operational guarantees.

## Network Philosophy

Quantumpay Mainnet is designed to be:

- Boring rather than flashy
- Predictable rather than experimental
- Conservative rather than aggressive
- Infrastructure-first rather than speculative

The network favors long-term reliability over short-term growth.

## Legal and Regulatory Posture

Quantumpay Mainnet is an open, neutral protocol.

- It does not represent an investment product
- It does not promise financial returns
- It does not provide custodial or intermediary services

Any services built on top of the protocol are separate from the protocol itself and subject to their own legal frameworks.

## Final Statement

With this declaration, Quantumpay Mainnet commits to operating as stable public infrastructure.

All future changes will respect the immutability of the ledger, the fixed Chain ID, and the trust of node operators and users.

This declaration is intended to remain valid for the lifetime of the Quantumpay Mainnet.
