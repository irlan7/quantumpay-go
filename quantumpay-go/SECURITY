# Security Policy

Quantumpay takes security and protocol integrity seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Quantumpay protocol or node implementation:

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
- **Do not** disclose details publicly

Please report the issue privately to the maintainer via email or a trusted communication channel.

Include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- Core node implementation
- Consensus and state transition logic
- Network and transaction handling

Service-layer components (dashboards, APIs, managed services) may have separate security policies.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure process:
- Issues are investigated privately
- Fixes are prepared before public disclosure
- Credit may be given to reporters where appropriate

Thank you for helping keep Quantumpay secure and reliable.
