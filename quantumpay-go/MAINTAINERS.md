# Maintainers

This document defines the maintainer role for the Quantumpay protocol.

Quantumpay is an infrastructure-grade blockchain project.  
Maintainers are responsible for preserving the correctness, security, and stability of the protocol.

## Maintainer Role

Maintainers have the following responsibilities:

- Reviewing and approving pull requests
- Protecting protocol correctness and determinism
- Making final decisions on protocol-level changes
- Managing releases and versioning
- Handling security disclosures responsibly

Maintainers are expected to act in the best interest of the protocol and its long-term users.

## Authority

- Maintainers have final authority over merges to the main branch
- Submitting a pull request does not guarantee acceptance
- Consensus rules and protocol behavior are treated as protocol law
- No individual maintainer may arbitrarily modify ledger state

There are no hidden administrator privileges beyond what is visible in the source code.


## Maintainer Selection

At this stage, maintainers are appointed by the project initiator.

As the network matures, the maintainer model may evolve to include:
- Additional maintainers
- Formal review processes
- Foundation or stewardship oversight

Any such changes will be publicly documented.

## Expectations

Maintainers are expected to:

- Prioritize safety over speed
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Be conservative with protocol changes
- Communicate changes clearly through documentation and releases

## Contact

For protocol-related matters, maintainers may be contacted through established project communication channels.

Security issues should follow the process described in `SECURITY.md`.

## Summary

Maintainers exist to protect the protocol, not to control it.

The maintainer role is intentionally conservative to ensure Quantumpay remains stable, neutral, and reliable infrastructure.
