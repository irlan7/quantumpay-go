Quantumpay Protocol Governance

1. Purpose

This document defines the governance model of the Quantumpay Protocol.

Governance exists to:

Preserve protocol integrity

Protect long-term network stability

Prevent unilateral control

Ensure transparent, predictable decision-making


Quantumpay governance is intentionally conservative, minimal, and slow-moving.


2. Governance Philosophy

Quantumpay follows these core principles:

1. Protocol > Organization
The protocol exists independently of any company, foundation, or individual.


2. Stability Over Velocity
Protocol changes are rare and carefully controlled.


3. Transparency by Default
All governance decisions, wallets, and changes are publicly observable.


4. No Founder Privilege
Founders have no special protocol authority beyond standard network participation.


5. Determinism First
Governance must never compromise deterministic execution or chain safety.


3. Governance Scope

Governance applies to:

Protocol rules

Consensus parameters

Genesis state and chain identity

Upgrade procedures

Emergency response policies


Governance does NOT apply to:

Application-layer services

Off-chain businesses

Private infrastructure

Third-party integrations

4. Governance Structure

Quantumpay governance consists of three layers:

4.1 Protocol Layer (Immutable Core)

Deterministic blockchain engine

State machine logic

Block structure and validation rules


Status:
🔒 Architecture Frozen

Changes to this layer require:

Formal governance proposal

Multi-phase review

Explicit community signaling

Long activation delays

4.2 Governance Process Layer

Defines how changes can occur.

Key characteristics:

Proposal-based

Documented in-repo

Public review period

Explicit activation conditions


No hidden or emergency backdoors exist.

4.3 Execution Layer (Nodes)

Nodes execute governance-approved changes

Nodes may choose whether to upgrade

No forced upgrades


5. Founder Role & Limitations

Founders:

Are regular network participants

May run nodes

May hold tokens


Founders cannot:

Modify protocol rules unilaterally

Change consensus parameters

Override governance decisions

Introduce hidden control mechanisms


Founder wallets are governed by the Founder Allocation Policy and Founder Wallet Disclosure.

6. Founder Wallet Transparency

All founder wallets:

Are publicly disclosed

Are traceable on-chain

Follow standard transaction rules

Have no special privileges


Any movement of founder funds:

Appears as standard on-chain transactions

Is visible via transaction hash (TXID)

Is observable by all network participants


There are no private, shielded, or obfuscated founder transactions.

FOUNDER_WALLET_DISCLOSURE.md


7. Governance Change Control

7.1 Proposal Requirements

All governance changes require:

Written proposal (in-repo)

Clear scope and rationale

Risk analysis

Backward compatibility assessment

Activation conditions


7.2 Review Period

Mandatory public review window

No fast-track governance

No silent changes


7.3 Activation Rules

Governance approval ≠ forced activation

Nodes decide independently to upgrade

Chain splits are avoided by design, not coercion


8. Emergency Governance

Quantumpay does not support discretionary emergency powers.

In extreme cases:

Emergency procedures must be pre-defined

No single party may act alone

Transparency remains mandatory


If no safe resolution exists, network safety takes precedence over continuity.

9. Chain Identity & Genesis Freeze

Chain ID is permanently fixed at mainnet launch

Genesis parameters are immutable after declaration

Any incompatible change requires a new network


See:

GENESIS_FREEZE.md

MAINNET_DECLARATION.md


10. Relationship with Legal Entities

Legal entities (e.g. Foundation or PT):

Cannot control the protocol

Cannot modify consensus

Cannot override governance


They may:

Provide services

Fund development

Support ecosystem growth


Protocol governance remains independent and neutral.


11. Transparency Commitments

Quantumpay commits to:

Public governance documents

Public decision records

Open protocol discussions

Clear historical archives


See:

HISTORY.md

ARCHIVE.md


12. Governance Immutability Clause

Once mainnet is declared:

Governance rules become binding

Retroactive changes are prohibited

Trust is preserved through consistency, not authority


13. Final Statement

Quantumpay governance is designed to ensure that:

> No one can silently change the rules.
No one is above the protocol.
Trust emerges from structure, not personalities.
