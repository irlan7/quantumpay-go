Investors do not control consensus

Investors do not receive special protocol privileges

All protocol changes follow published governance processes

Investment supports infrastructure and ecosystem, not protocol capture.

Governed by published policies

Responsible Web3 funding standards

Regulator-friendly disclosure principles

Ethical communication and investor protection


8. Final Statement
