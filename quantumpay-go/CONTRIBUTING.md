# Contributing to Quantumpay

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quantumpay.

Quantumpay is an infrastructure-grade blockchain protocol.  
We prioritize correctness, determinism, and long-term stability over speed or feature quantity.

Please read this document carefully before submitting any contribution.

## Scope of Contributions

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Bug fixes (deterministic, reproducible)
- Performance improvements (measured and documented)
- Code readability and refactoring (no behavior change)
- Tests (unit, integration, snapshot, replay)
- Documentation improvements

We do **not** accept speculative features, experimental changes, or breaking behavior without prior discussion.

## What Is Out of Scope

The following will not be accepted:

- Consensus rule changes without prior design discussion
- New transaction types without specification
- Feature requests driven by hype or ecosystem trends
- Business logic, monetization, or service-layer code
- Changes that increase complexity without clear benefit

Quantumpay favors boring, stable, and predictable systems.

## Contribution Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature or fix branch
3. Make small, focused commits
4. Include tests where applicable
5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a clear explanation

All PRs are reviewed by maintainers.  
Submitting a PR does **not** guarantee acceptance.

## Code Standards

- Code must be deterministic
- No hidden side effects
- No global mutable state without justification
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Follow existing code style and structure

If a change is difficult to explain, it is likely not suitable.

## Security Issues

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities via public issues.

If you believe you have found a security issue, contact the maintainer privately.

## Governance & Decision Making

Quantumpay follows a maintainer-driven model.

- Maintainers have final authority over merges
- Consensus rules are treated as protocol law
- Stability and safety override feature velocity

Governance processes may evolve over time, but core principles remain unchanged.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.

Thank you for helping keep Quantumpay stable, secure, and boring.
