Clarification:

QuantumPay is NOT affiliated with:

Experimental Rust blockchain projects

Personal learning repositories

Academic or toy blockchain implementations

Any project not explicitly referencing QuantumPay Mainnet


Similarity in naming does not imply technical, legal, or organizational relationship.
