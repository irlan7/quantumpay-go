Any personal data collection occurs **outside the protocol**, for example:

Those services must publish their own privacy policies.

## 4. Node Operation & IP Addresses

Each participant is responsible for their own data usage and compliance with local regulations.

## 7. Regulatory Alignment

Quantumpay is designed to be compatible with:
- Data minimization principles
- Transparency-by-design
- Regulatory compliance at the application layer

Compliance obligations (GDPR, local privacy laws, etc.) apply to **service providers**, not the protocol itself.
