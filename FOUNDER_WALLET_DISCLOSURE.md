Purpose:

Long-term alignment with protocol success

Compensation for initial protocol design, engineering, and stewardship

No short-term liquidity objective

Founder allocation does not grant special protocol privileges.

3. Founder Wallet Characteristics

All founder wallets adhere to the following principles:

Publicly visible blockchain addresses

Recorded at or after Genesis Block

Subject to predefined lock-up and vesting rules

No hidden minting, rebasing, or privileged transfer paths

5. Transaction Transparency

Any movement of founder funds will:

Appear as standard on-chain transactions

Be traceable by transaction hash (TXID)

Be visible to all network participants in real time


There are no private or obfuscated transactions for founder wallets.

Example reference:

> Public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum) regularly display large-value transactions linked to known entities via explorers.

Quantumpay follows the same transparency standard.
